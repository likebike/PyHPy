<h1>About nomake.org:</h1>
<p>If you don't have root access, Linux software installation is way more difficult than it needs to be.  The purpose of nomake.org is to provide self-conatined, standalone tar packages of popular Linux apps that are easy to extract and run... all without root!  The packages contain all dependencies and will run on any Linux distribution.</p>
<p>The packages on nomake.org are designed to be useful for people who need to use a Linux computer without root access -- for example, if you have a shared web hosting account with SSH access (but no package manager), or if you need to work on a corporate Linux network, where application installation is often extremely difficult or against IT policy.  These packages allow you to simply download, un-tar, and run... without ANY build process, root access, or package manager.</p>
<p>Since *all* dependencies are included in our packages, they tend to be large.  But these days, your time is much more valuable than your disk space.  Many people prefer to just "download and run" instead of trying to figure out how to build a package from source.</p>
<p>Also, nomake.org is good for you and good for our environment because it is asbestos-free, gluten-free, organic, biodegradeable, and low in sodium.</p>


<h1>How the Packages are Made:</h1>
<p>It's pretty simple.  We use 'apt' on Ubuntu 10.04 to install an app on our computer, then we use a combination of 'rpath', 'strace', and 'ldd' to bundle the new app and all of its dependencies into its own chroot.  Once it's working in the chroot, we tar it up and upload it here.

<p>The above process is currently done manually, but in the future, we hope to automate it so we can bundle more packages, faster.</p>
