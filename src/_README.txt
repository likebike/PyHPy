'www' is where you create web content, such as HTML, CSS, JS, and TMPL files.

'apps' contains JSON files that are used to produce many of the TMPL files in
'www/apps'.  We are using JSON files (rather than TMPL directly) because JSON is
a language neutral data format, and it will easily allow us to migrate this
website to more advanced technologies in the future.
