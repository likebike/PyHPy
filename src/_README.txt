'www' is where web content is created.  This contains HTML, CSS, JS, and TMPL
files.

'apps' contains JSON files that are used to produce many of the TMPL files in
'www'.  We are using JSON files (rather than TMPL directly) because JSON is a
language neutral data format, and it will easily allow us to migrate this
website to more advanced technologies in the future.
