This is the 'cache' folder.  Everything served from here will be cached
aggressively on the browser side.

'css' is where this website's CSS files are stored.

'img' is where this website's images are stored, such as the background image,
logo, etc.

'js' is where this website's javascript files are stored.

'lib' is where third-party content (such as javascript, CSS, and images) are
stored.

'screenshots' is where app screenshots are stored.  This is the "permalink"
path to them.  You can also link to the same screenshots via the /d path,
which allows the links to expire periodically.  I think it's good to have
permalinks for the screenshots so we can maximize visibility via Google Images
and other things like that.
